                <h2>About Athr</h2>
                <p>Athr was founded with a clear mission: to provide organizations with actionable threat intelligence that is both timely and easy to understand. In a digital landscape filled with noise, we cut through the clutter to deliver alerts that matter. We believe that proactive security shouldn't be a luxury reserved for the few, but a standard accessible to all.</p>
                <p>Our value proposition is simple. We monitor a vast array of sources, from the dark web to public code repositories, for any mention of your organization's assets. When a potential threat is detected—be it a credential leak, a vulnerable piece of software, or chatter from a known threat actor—we don't just notify you; we provide you with the context and actionable steps needed to mitigate the risk immediately. This focus on "actionable" intelligence is what sets us apart.</p>
                <p>Key features of the Athr platform include our secure search capabilities, which allow you to instantly query our database of monitored sources; live alerts that are prioritized based on severity; and visual analytics that help you understand your organization's threat landscape over time. With Athr, you can move from a reactive to a proactive security posture, stopping threats before they can impact your business.</p>
